#### Series:
- It is like a column of data in a table and 1D array holding any data type
- syntax:
  - variable = pandas.series(array)
- If nothing else is specified, the values are labeled with their index number. First value has index 0, second value has index 1 etc
- With the index argument, you can name your own labels
- syntax:
  - variable = pandas.series(array, index = [a,b,c])
- Key/Value Objects as Series
  - use a key/value object, like a dictionary, when creating a Series
