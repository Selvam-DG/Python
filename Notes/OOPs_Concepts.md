# Why OOPs?
- Problems in a regular program with many thousands of lines
 - No code reusability of existing
 - Debugging and finding errors is difficult
 - Very difficult to understand the behavior of application if the number of lines of code is more


#### In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming
- aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming
- this concept is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.
#### OOPs Concepts in Python
- Class
- Objects
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Data Abstraction
### Class:
- Blueprint or model to create an object is known as class.
- Class represents the common behavior of the group of objects
- Simply, A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created.
- A class is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods
- Attribute is variable and methods are behaviors in class (method is nothing but functions inside the class)
- **Note**:
  - Classes are created by keyword class.
  - Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
  - Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator
 - syntax:
    - class ClassName:
       - statement1
       - statement2 ....
       - statement-n
- Attributes and behavior are the members of class
 ### Objects:
 - The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it.
 - An object consists of:
   - **State**: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
   - **Behavior**: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
   - **Identity**: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
 - A Class is defined without an object but without a class, object can't be defined.
 
#### Python __init__ Method
- __init__ method is constructor, it is run as soon as an object of a class is mapped.
- The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
#### The Python self  
- Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not
- give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it
- If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument

#### Types of Variable
 - Instance variable
 - Class variable (static variable)
