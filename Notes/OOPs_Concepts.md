# Why OOPs?
- Problems in a regular program with many thousands of lines
 - No code reusability of existing
 - Debugging and finding errors is difficult
 - Very difficult to understand the behavior of application if the number of lines of code is more


#### In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming
- aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming
- this concept is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.
#### OOPs Concepts in Python
- Class
- Objects
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Data Abstraction
### Class:
- Blueprint or model to create an object is known as class.
- Class represents the common behavior of the group of objects
- Simply, A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods
- **Note**:
  - Classes are created by keyword class.
  - Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
  - Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator
