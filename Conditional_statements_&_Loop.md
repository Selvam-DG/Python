### Conditional Statements in Python
- The if statement
- The if-else statement
- The nested-if statement
- The if-elif-else ladder
#### if statment
- syntax:
  - if condition:
    - Statements to execute
      - if
        - condition is true
  
#### if else:
- syntax:
  - if condition:
     - statement 1
  - else:
     - statement 2
#### if-else if-else:
- syntax:
  -  if condition:
     - statement 1
  - elif:
     - statement 2
  - elif:
     - statement 3
  - else:
     - statement 4

### Loops in Python
  - for, while, continue and break
#### for
  - For loop is used to execute a block of code multiple times, only if number of iterations is known in advance
- syntax:
   - for i in range():
      - statements
- used to do iteration or operation by the index of sequences
- used to do the operation on the sequence or map by element-wise.
- we can use else statement with for loop in Python
- syntax:
  -  for i in range():
     - statement 1
  - else:
     - statement 2
#### While:
- a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a give condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.
- syntax:
   - while condition:
      - code/statements
      - increment / decrement
- syntax with else:
   - while condition:
     - execute these statements
   - else:
     - execute these statements

#### Nested Loops
- use one loop inside another loop
- Syntax:
  - for iterator_var in sequence:
     - for iterator_var in sequence:
       -statements(s)
  - statements(s)
- syntax
 - while expression:
  - while expression: 
      - statement(s)
  - statement(s)
#### Loop Control Statements:
- Break and continue are used in the loop
- Break is used to terminate the current loop completely.
- Continue is used to skip the current iteration in the loop
